    <h2 class="heading2"> accessed through js </h2>
    <button id="btn"> Click me!</button>
    <input type="text" id="input" value="Enter your name">
    <script src = "DOM1.js"></script>          
</body>
</html>

Q-1 Why script written in head tag is not working?
/*script should be written in last conventionally but could be written in our head tag also . 
But when written in head our js code will be lopaded first than our html code.*/
//then dom elements will not be accesible and on console.dir(body) will give null .
//thats why we should write script in end.
