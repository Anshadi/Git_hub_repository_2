first i hadn't imported the junit
I got that idea as the @test annotation was not being identified .

we can do it by pressing enable java test button in testing

Then the test class was saying not in the project path
So i had to put it in the src folder

Then created the revstring in the main folder inside src
so i can give the package name to revstring
