havent wrote its note --


first things first 
 - we can write at the start @enableBatchProcessing , but it was done in the previous versions now we don't have to write it .Could give error .

 There could be error relating to  batch job instance but it can be solved using 



 spring.sql.init.mode=always
spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema=always

as it will automatically create the schema and table for us that are required or we can manaually copy the schema creation code from the git hub to our schema.sql file .


Now another thing is that maybe on starting the server of iris in postgres it won't run , it maybe because i am using Docker too so there is some type of ip subnet mask conflict so i have to run the postgres-container in docker then i have to login to my database and then i can connect to the server from pgadmin4 .

And in the  Flat File Item Reader , we have to skip the header line so it doesn't take it and give error so we use 
    .linesToSkip(1) // This skips the header row


And we can't keep both the class name and the csv file name same as Iris because when we will mention the path , it will take iris.java path and not the Iris.csv one .


docker start postgres-container
docker ps
docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U root -d Iris
