There should be a page which tells which places the user have already visited.
we can do 
user places visited history -- capped collection
Transaction History -- Capped Collection
data of places --  Normalization
Profile System -- Denormalized

In transaction and visited history Keep _id date_ - so we can limit no. of dates and use capped collection
