web sockets are important 
they can be used for multiple purposes

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. They are designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but can be used in any application where real-time communication is needed. Here are some key aspects and benefits of WebSockets:
1. **Real-Time Communication:**
    
    - WebSockets enable real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
    - Unlike traditional request-response communication (like HTTP), where the client initiates requests and the server responds, WebSockets allow both the client and server to send messages at any time.
2. **Low Latency:**
    
    - WebSockets are designed to reduce latency compared to traditional polling or long-polling techniques.
    - Once a WebSocket connection is established, data can be sent or received almost instantly.
3. **Efficiency:**
    
    - WebSockets use a single, long-lived connection for multiple messages, reducing the overhead associated with opening and closing connections for each exchange.
    - This efficiency is particularly useful for applications requiring frequent updates or real-time data, such as chat applications, online gaming, financial trading platforms, and live notifications.
4. **Push Notifications:**
    
    - WebSockets are often used to implement push notification systems.
    - Servers can push updates to clients as soon as new information is available, eliminating the need for clients to repeatedly poll the server for updates.
5. **Bi-Directional Communication:**
    
    - Both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing for true bi-directional data flow.
    - This is beneficial for applications where the server needs to send data to the client without the client explicitly requesting it.
6. **WebSockets API:**
    
    - Modern web browsers provide a WebSocket API that developers can use to establish and manage WebSocket connections in their applications.
    - The API includes events for handling connection open, message receipt, errors, and connection closure.
7. **Protocols:**
    
    - WebSockets operate on the WebSocket protocol (ws:// or wss:// for secure connections), which is designed to work over the same ports as HTTP and HTTPS (ports 80 and 443).
    - The secure variant (wss://) provides encryption using TLS/SSL for secure communication.

WebSockets are widely used in various web and mobile applications where real-time communication and updates are crucial. They offer a more efficient and responsive alternative to traditional HTTP-based communication for certain use cases.
