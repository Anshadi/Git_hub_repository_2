If we are making a quiz , then in the repository we will ask the creator to send the questions along with the answer too .
But when we are showing these to the user , then we have to create another repository where it don't contain right answer field and then from getting questions from questions repository , we have to set it to that class using loop .


Its good to store the complete answer rather than the option no. because it provides us the flexibility of randomizing the options on the user side , because in response we will always going to check the answer rather than the option number .
