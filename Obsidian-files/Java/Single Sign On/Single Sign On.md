There are 3 parties involved - 
- User 
- Service Provider
- Identity Provider

For Ex- When a user tries to open a homepage of a website , that request will be redirected to the SP ( Service Provider ) i.e. the web App Server  .
Which will redirect this request to the AD (Active Directory) Server which will authenticate whether the request as well as the user is legitimate or not .
So this will generate a Saml auth. request and will pass it on to AD server .
Now this AD will authenticate all the requests and all the req. will come to it in the form of XML form .
So Saml Request will be In XML form .
When User will be authenticated by it , a SAML Token will be generated by it which will be done by IDP (Identity Provider ) .
This token will have different attribute and info about the user , then this XML response will go back to the Browser from where the request is made .
Once the req. reaches the browser , this browser will redirect this token to the SP 
It will validate the SAML response previously it had with the help of this token .
If it  is a valid token it will grant access to that particular secured page .
Once this token is assigned , there will be a validity to this particular token . Ex- for entire session or a time window .
During this time period , the user didn't need to validate again and again .
